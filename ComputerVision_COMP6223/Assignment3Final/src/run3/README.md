## Task.
You should try to develop the best classifier you can! You can choose whatever feature, encoding and classifier you like. Potential features: the GIST feature; Dense SIFT; Dense SIFT in a Gaussian Pyramid; Dense SIFT with spatial pooling (i.e. PHOW as in the OpenIMAJ tutorial), etc. Potential classifiers: Naive bayes; non-linear SVM (perhaps using a linear classifier with a Homogeneous Kernel Map), … Note: you don’t have to use OpenIMAJ for this run if you don’t want to (for example you might want to try and use a deep learning framework instead).
